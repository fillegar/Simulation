# Tricentis Simulation Examples

This repository contains practical examples for using Tricentis Simulation, a key capability of [Tricentis Tosca](https://www.tricentis.com/products/automate-continuous-testing-tosca/api-simulation/) designed to support API simulation and service virtualization. These examples demonstrate how to simulate APIs and virtual services to enable reliable and continuous testing, even when dependent systems are not available.

## What is Tricentis Simulation

Tricentis Simulation allows testers and developers to simulate the behavior of APIs, services, and components that are not yet implemented, are unstable, or are otherwise unavailable. By virtualizing these dependencies, you can

- Continue development and testing without waiting for other teams or systems.
- Avoid delays due to test environment unavailability.
- Simulate edge cases and negative scenarios that are difficult to reproduce in real systems.
- Enable parallel work across teams in complex microservice architectures.

Simulation is essential in shift-left testing and continuous testing strategies, helping teams catch issues early and increase release velocity.

## What's in this Repository

This repository includes hands-on examples that illustrate how to use Tricentis Simulation in real-world scenarios. Each example is designed to be self-contained and comes with detailed explanations to help you understand the concepts and tools involved.

### üìÅ Examples Overview

 Folder  Description 
---------------------
